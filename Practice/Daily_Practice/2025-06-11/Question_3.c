Q). Consider an undirected graph(unweighted). If BFS of G is done from a node 'r' let d(r,u) and d(r,v) be the lengths of the shortest paths from r to u and v. If 'u' is visited before 'v', during the traversal, then which is true ?

(a). d(r,u) < d(r,v)        (b). d(r,u) > d(r,v)        (c). d(r,u) <= d(r,v)           (d). None

Ans). (c)
