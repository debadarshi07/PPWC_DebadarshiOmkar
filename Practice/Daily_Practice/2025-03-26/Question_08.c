Q). A square band matrix Dn,a is nxn matrix in which all non-zero elements lie in band around the main diagonal. The elements includes the main diagonal and a - 1 diagonal elements below and above main diagonal. How many non zero elements are presents in in square band matrix Dn,a?

(A) (2a - 1) - a(a - 1)
(B) n + (a - 1)[2n - a]
(C) n + (a - 1)[2n + a]
(D) n + (a + 1)[2n - a]

Ans). (B)
