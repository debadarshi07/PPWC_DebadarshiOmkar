Q). Suppose a BST with 37 distinct elements is also a CBT. The tree is stored using the array representation of binary heap trees. Assuming that the array indices start with the 1. Largest element of the tree is stored at index X and smallest element is stored at index Y, then X + Y is _____.

Ans). Index of smallest element = 32
      Index of largest element = 31
      X + Y = 31 + 32 = 63
