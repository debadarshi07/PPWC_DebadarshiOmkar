Q). Consider a hash table with 9 slots. The hash function collision is resolved by chaining. The following 9 keys are inserted in the order: 5, 28, 19, 15, 20, 33, 12, 17, 10 with hash function h(x) = x % 9. The maximum, minimum and average chain lengths in the hash table, respectively are
(a). 3, 0, 1        (b). 3, 3, 3        (c). 4, 0, 1        (d). 3, 0, 2
