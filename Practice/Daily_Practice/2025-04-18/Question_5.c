Q). Consider hash table with 100 slots. Collisions are resolved using chaining. Assume a simple uniform hashing, what is the probability that the first 3 slots are unfilled after the first three insertions?
(a). (97 * 97 * 97) / 100続              (b). (99 * 98 * 97) / 100続
(c). (97 * 96 * 95) / 100続              (d). (97 * 96 * 95) / (3! * 100続)

Ans). (a)
