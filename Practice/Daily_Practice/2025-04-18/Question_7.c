Q). A hash table of length 10 uses open addressing with hash function h(k) = k mod 10, and linear probing. After inserting 6 values into an empty hash table, the table is as shown below

    0 --> 
    1 --> 
    2 --> 42
    3 --> 23
    4 --> 34
    5 --> 52
    6 --> 46
    7 --> 33
    8 --> 
    9 --> 

    Which one of the following choices gives a possible order in which the key values coule have been inserted in the table ?
    (a). 46, 42, 34, 52, 23, 33
    (b). 34, 42, 23, 52, 33, 46
    (c). 46, 34, 42, 23, 52, 33
    (d). 42, 46, 33, 23, 34, 52

    Ans). (c)
