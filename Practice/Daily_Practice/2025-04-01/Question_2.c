Q). A complete n-ary tree is a tree in which each node has n children. Let I be the number of internal nodes and L be the numbers of leaves in a complete n-ary tree. If L = 41, and I = 10. What is the value of n ?

(a). 3              (b). 4
(c). 5              (d). 6

Ans). We know, L = I(k - 1) + 1
            => 41 = 10(k - 1) + 1
            => k - 1 = 40 / 10
            => k = 4 + 1
            => k = 5
    ans -> (c)
