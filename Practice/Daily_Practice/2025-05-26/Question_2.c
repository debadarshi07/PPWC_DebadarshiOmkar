Q). A message is made up entirely of characters from the set X = {P, Q, R, S, T}. The table probabilites for each of the characters is shown below.

            Characters              Probability
                P                      0.22
                Q                      0.34
                R                      0.17
                S                      0.19
                T                      0.08
              Total                    1.00 

If a message of 100 characters over X is encoded using Huffman coding, then the expected length of the encoded message in bits is _____.

Ans). 225
