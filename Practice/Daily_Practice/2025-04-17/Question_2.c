/*

Q). A queue is implemented using a non-circular singly linkedlist. The queue has a head pointer and a tail pointer. Let n decide the number of nodes in the queue. Let 'enqueue' be implemented by inserting a new node at the head, and 'dequeue' be implemented by deletion of a node from the tail.

Which one of the following is the time complexity of the most time efficient implementation of 'enqueue' and 'dequeue', repectively for this data structure ?
(a). Theta(1), Theta(1)
(b). Theta(1), Theta(n)
(c). Theta(n), Theta(1)
(d). Theta(n), Theta(n)

Ans). (b)
