Q). An articulation point in a connected graph is a vertex such that removing the vertex and its incident edges disconnects the graph into two or more connected components. Let T be a DFS tree obtained by doing DFS in a connected graph G. Which of the following options is/are correct ?

(a). Root of T can never be an articulation point in G.
(b). If u is an articulation point in G such that x is an ancestor of u in T and y is an descedant of u in T, then all paths from x to y in G must pass through u.
(c). A leaf of T can be an articulation point in G.
(d). Root of T is an articulation point in G iff it has 2 or more children.

Ans). (d)
