Q). Consider a graph with 'n' vertices n > 2. The vertices are numbered V1 to Vn. Two vertices Vi and Vj are adjacent iff 0 < |i - j| <= 2. The weight of such an edge is i + j. The weight of minimum cost spanning tree of such a graph for a value of n is _____. 

(a). n² - n             (b). n² + n + 1             (c). n² - n - 1             (d). n² - n + 1

Ans). (d)
