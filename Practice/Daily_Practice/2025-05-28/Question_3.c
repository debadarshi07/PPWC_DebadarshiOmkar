Q). Consider a graph whose vertices are points in a plane with integer coordinates (x, y) where 1 <= x <= n, n > 2 is an integer. 2 vertices <x1, y1> & <x2, y2> are adjacent iff |x1 - x2| and |y1 - y2| <= 1. The cost of such an edge is given by the distance between them. Compute the weight of min cost spanning tree of such graph for a given value of n.

(a). n²         (b). (n² - 1) * 2           (c). n² - 1             (d). n(n - 1)

Ans). (c)
