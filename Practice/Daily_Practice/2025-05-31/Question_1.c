Q). Consider a weighted undirected graph with positive edge weights and let uv be an edge in the graph. It is known that the shortest path from the sources vertex s to u has weight 53 and the shortest path from s to v has weight 65. Which one of the following statements is always true ?

(a). Weight(u,v) < 12               (b). Weight(u,v) <= 12
(c). Weight(u,v) > 12               (d). Weight(u,v) >= 12

Ans). (d)
