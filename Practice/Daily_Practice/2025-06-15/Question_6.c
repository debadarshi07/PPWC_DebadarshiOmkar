Q). An array X of n distinct integers is interpreted as a complete binary tree. The index of the first element of array is 0. If only the root node does not satisfy the heap property, the algorithm to convert the complete binary tree into a heap has the best asymptotic time complexity of 

(a). O(n)           (b). O(logn)            (c). O(n logn)          (d). O(n loglogn)

Ans). (b)
