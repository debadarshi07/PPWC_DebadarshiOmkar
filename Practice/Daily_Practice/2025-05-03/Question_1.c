Q). An array A of length n with distinct elements is said to be bitonic if there is an index 1 ≤ i ≤ n such that A[1..i] is sorted in the non-decreasing order and A[i+1..n] is sorted in the non-increasing order.Which ONE of the following represents the best possible asymptotic bound for the worst-case number of comparisons by an algorithm that searches for an element in a bitonic array A?

(a). Θ(n)
(b). Θ(1)
(c). Θ(log²n)
(d). Θ(logn)

Ans). (c)
