Q). G = (V,E) is an undirected simple graph in each edge has a distinct weight, and e is particular edge of G. Which of the following statement about the minimum spanning tree(MSTs) of G is/are True ?

    I. If e is the highest edge of some cycle in G, then every MST of G includes e.
    II. If e is the heaviest edge of some cycle in G, then every MST of G excludes e.

(a). I only      (b). II only       (c). Both I and II          (d). Neither I nor II

Ans). (b)
