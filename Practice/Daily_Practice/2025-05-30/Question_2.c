Q). Let G be a connected undirected weighted graph. Consider the following two statements.

    S1: There exists a minimum weight edge in G which is present in every minimum spanning tree of G.
    S2: If every edge in G has distinct weight, then G has a unique minimum spanning tree.

(a). Both S1 and S2 are true                (b). S1 is true and S2 is false
(c). S1 is false and S2 is true             (d). Both S1 and S2 are false

Ans). (c)
