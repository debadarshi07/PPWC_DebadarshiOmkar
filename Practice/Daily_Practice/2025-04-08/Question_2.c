Q). If BST constructed with following keys
    2,1,4,7,9,10,15
    Then for how many choices of root node total 28 BST will be possible ?

Ans). There can be two such roots i.e. 4 and 9 using which total 28 BST will be possible. One side of the root should have 2 nodes and another side should have 4 because catalan(2) * catalan(4) = 28
