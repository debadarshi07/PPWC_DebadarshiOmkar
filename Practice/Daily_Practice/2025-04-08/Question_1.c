Q). If BST constructed with following keys.
    4, 2, 1, 7, 10, 12, 13
    If 7 is the root, then no of BST possible is _____.

Ans). 4,2,1 can come at the left subtree in Catalan(3) = 5 ways
      10, 12, 13 can come at the right subtree in Catalan(3) = 5 ways
      Total no. of trees that can be formed = 5 * 5 = 25
