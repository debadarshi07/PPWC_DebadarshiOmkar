Q). Consider a hash table of size 10 with indices 0 to 9, with the hash function h(x) = 3x mod 10; where linear probing is used to handle collisions. The hash table is initially empty and then the following sequence of keys is inserted into the table: 1, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15. The indices where the keys 14 and 15 are stored are, respectively
(a). 2 and 5        (b). 2 and 6        (c). 4 and 5        (d). 4 and 6

Ans). (d)
