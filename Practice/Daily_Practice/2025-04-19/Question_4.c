Q). In a double hashing scheme, h1(k) = k mod 11 and h2(k) = 1 + (k mod 7) are the auxiliary hash functions. The size m of the hash table is 11. The hash function for the i-th probe in the open address table is [h1(k) + i*h2(k)] mod m. The following keys are inserted in the given order: 63, 50, 25, 79, 67, 24. The slot at which the key 24 gets stored is _____.
