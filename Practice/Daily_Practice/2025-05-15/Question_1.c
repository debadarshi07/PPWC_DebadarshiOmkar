Q). If one uses straight two way merge sort algorithm to sort the following elements is ascending order.
    20, 47, 15, 8, 9, 4, 40, 30, 12, 17
    Then the order of these elements after second pass of algorithm is

    (a). 8, 9, 15, 20, 47, 4, 12, 17, 30, 40
    (b). 8, 15, 20, 47, 4, 9, 30, 40, 12, 17
    (c). 15, 20, 47, 4, 8, 9, 12, 30, 40, 17
    (d). 4, 8, 9, 15, 20, 47, 12, 17, 30, 40

    Ans). (b)
